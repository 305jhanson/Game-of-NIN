# Game-of-NIN
A simple game where the player must choose to remove any number of sticks from a row until one of the players has to remove the last stick.

The player that takes the last stick loses the game.

The user can chose to play against another person or a computer algorithm.
The user can also chose not to play and let 2 algorithms play against each other.

I have implemented three different algorithms.
1. bornLoser which takes all the sticks from the largest row
2. oneAtATime which picks one stick from the first available row
3. myFunction: my algorithm
